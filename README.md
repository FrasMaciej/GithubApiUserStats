This is my first ever written application that is using API

With this simple app you can check summary/statistics of bytes of code written by selected github user in each programming language.
Application uses public Github Api to obtain all data. 

UI:
	.Hello, this is an application thanks to which you can check any GitHub user data: 
	
          Login, name, bio and list of repositories
	  
        .To get it, just write in your browsers:
	
          http://localhost:8080/user_name/name
	  
        .In the field 'name' you should write selected user
	
          The results will be written in the console text interface and in your browser as json
